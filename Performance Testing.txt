Performance Testing:   
--------------------
                        It ensures the S/W applications will perform well under their expected workload.
                     -->how the application work on desired load.
Attributes of P/T::::  
                      1) Speed      : It checks whether the response of the application is fast or not
                      2)Scalability : It determines the maximum load 
                      3)Stability   : It checks if the application is stable under varying loads.
Performance testing :  Types :                                   Tools:
---------------------          1)Load Testing                          1)Apache JMeter
                               2)Stress Testing                        2)AppLoader
                               3)Endurance Testing                     3)WebLoad
                               4)Spike Testing                         4)LoadRunner
                               5)Volume Testing                        5)NeoLoad
                               Scalability Testing                     6)Silk Performer.
3)Endurance Testing :how the application perform under the long duration of load
4)Spike Testing     : somtimes the load is varying i.e., some times load is high and sometimes less
 

Automai Apploader testing :
---------------------------
                      AppLoader is a software Quality Assurance and load testing solutions of all types of applications,incliding web applications
 

  ADVANTAGES  :  1) easy to use
                 2) protocal indipendent
                 3) No coading is required
                 4) Easy maintainance of scripts
                 5) Record the action any of the applications
DISADVANTAGES : 
                 1)Licensed tool 
                 2)Required the  additions- infrastructure to generate the load.

	
______________________________

                  gathering the requirements

                  identify the business scenarios

                  build a scenarios using scenario builder

                  send scenarios to controller(apploader)

                  design the scenario in the controller

                  execute the test run

                  monitor the test run in the injectors as well as controller

                  report problem

components of apploader:
_________________________

                 scenario builder-tool for creating a real-world scenario 

                 controller- organizes,drives,manages and monitors the load test

                 injectors-  manage rusers(real users) and generate the load

                 session controller- it clones the injector machine to avoid the configuration issues using the execution

Arcitecture of AppLoader
How to Create Scripts using Scenario Builder Elements.

How to  Create a test Plan and How the Execution will happen and How the AppLoader Tool Will be.


Once the Senario is ready than we need send to the Controller than only we can plan the Test.
**
  Clicking on send Scenario the particular Script Which we created will go to that appLoader Machine.
***
   Opening the AppLoader Application
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------
   We can see in the AppLoader:
--------------------------------
  
   how to create the test plan.
   How the test is going 
   Report  Analysis

the sent list is displaye din the

Injector Machine:
----------------
     In this we can see how many machines are connected to apploader
